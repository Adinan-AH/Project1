00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,430
The target has been secured.

00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,460
Our team is on the way back.

4
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,480
Command Center, this is Patrol Unit 00638.

00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
We're on our way back, over. Received.

6
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,530
It's time.

7
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,450
Start with a small pawn first.

8
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,480
What's wrong?

9
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,980
Maybe it's nothing. I felt
the screen flickered a bit earlier.

[LUSO SAFE AUTOMATIC ALARM]

Madam, the alarm in the Steel Room
at Bank Asia Macau has sounded.

12
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,450
CPSP police also received the alarm.
Their patrol unit is heading there.

13
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,470
Where is their nearest patrol unit?

14
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,400
They left 2 minutes
ago. On the bridge.

15
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,420
Estimated 5 minutes. Where is our team?

16
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,446
Madam, Captain Wu Yaolei here.

Skyeye trace found. Identified something.

24
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,440
They didn't want cash.

25
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,460
What do you mean? They
left empty-handed.

26
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,480
Madam, they were spotted on camera 120C,

27
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,410
exiting Liwan Circle, heading south.

28
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,436
Direct all nearby patrol cars
to intercept their escape route.

29
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,460
Understood, Madam.

30
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,480
Attention, all units.

31
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,400
The suspect's black MPV
is disguised as a taxi.

Spice Girl rejects this plan.
All units proceed to Cacilhas Street.

42
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,470
Prepare to intercept. Do not intercept.

Surround them on Repouso Street.

00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,460
Yes, Madam.

51
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,480
All units, disperse.

52
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,510
Ready sir. Ready sir.

53
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,430
Wu Yaolei.

54
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,460
Wu Yaolei, what are you doing?

55
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,480
Capture them! Come on, respond!

56
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,506
We're on Repouso Street. No
suspicious vehicle in sight.

57
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,530
What do you mean not in sight?

58
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,550
It's visible there, are you blind?

59
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,480
Madam.

60
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
Can Madam see me?

61
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,420
Ma'am.

62
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,450
How are we now, sir?

63
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,470
Pawn's out.

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,400

67
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,470
Morning, can I help you, sir?

68
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,490
Order a cup of latte.

69
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,420
Larry, you lazy bum, open the door!

70
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,440
What?

71
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,460
Police.

72
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,490
Sure you don't want to go to the bank?
Why would I want to go there?

73
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,516
A paper with half of
my signature has been stolen, right?

74
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,440
Right?

75
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,460
Maybe they won't act
this quickly.

76
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,486
No, they want the other half.
They need the other half.

77
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,510
Without the other half,
all this becomes useless.

78
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,430
What exactly is cryptocurrency?

79
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,460
Money, sir. More than
500 million Hong Kong dollars.

80
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,480
There's no answer at JH
Digital Asset Management.

81
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
SAFE. STRONG. SOLUTION

82
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,930
They might be
working on it now.

83
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,450
Hello, Aoxing Tower security office.

84
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,480
This is the Judicial Police Command Center.

85
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,400
We suspect someone on the 4th floor 

86
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,420
at JH Digital Asset Management
is involved in sensitive data theft.

87
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,450
Please don't act alone.
When will the police arrive?

88
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,470
What's your estimate? 5 minutes.

89
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
Understood.

90
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,420
3 minutes. Okay, 3 minutes.

91
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,440
Found it.

92
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,490
Whoa... there are a lot
of files. Copy everything.

93
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,420
Can't you transfer the money yourself?

94
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,440
The password for the crypto account consists
of 12 random English words.

95
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,460
It's 2048 to the power of 12.

96
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,490
That's the algorithm behind
it. You don't know anything.

97
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,510
Stay put.

98
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,540
Impossible to remember.

99
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,460

doing? Just browsing.

102
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,436
Don't touch anything else.

103
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,460

Gordon D.

105
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
What is this? A digital encryption key.

106
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,430
That's Duan Zhihong.

107
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,450
Who is that?

108
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,480
CEO of the largest crypto exchange in Kuala Lumpur.

109
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,400
He disappeared with $1.5 billion USD,

110
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,420
then was mysteriously
found dead in Macau.

111
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,970
People still think he
faked his own death.

112
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,470
The firewall for this digital key is

113
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Level TAQ-LX-5.

114
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,520
What does it mean? One level
less than military-grade.

115
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,440
Why is such an important key

116
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,470
hidden on a lousy server like
this? I heard Duan's $1.5 billion

117
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,490
is still unaccounted for.

118
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,420
That's more than HK$10 billion.

119
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
Copy everything.

120
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,460
We're running out of time, Simon. It won't take long.

121
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,490
Xin, let's go.

122
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,510
One more minute. No time left.

Let's go!

127
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,460
Duck down!

128
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,480
Don't look!

129
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,400
Police are at the entrance.

130
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,429
Don't panic.

131
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,430
What's happening upstairs?

132
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,450
Sorry.

133
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,480
Hi, can I help you? Police.

134
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,400
We received a report of a robbery.

135
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,540
The suspects just left. 4 men, early 20s.

136
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,450
Go, Bishop.

137
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,470
Quick, chase them!

138
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,500
Song, block them!

139
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,420
Don't run!

140
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
Alpha 3 has arrived.

141
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,470
Bravo-4 is on site.

142
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,490
Bravo 1 and 2, watch the lobby.

143
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,520
Bravo 3 and 4, block the exits.

144
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,540
Bravo-3 on site. Qiuguo,
assist Forensics on the 4th floor.

145
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,560
Yes, sir.

146
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,490
Stop!

147
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,410
Don't move!

148
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,440
Don't move! Don't move!

149
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,460
Drop the gun! Don't move!

150
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,480
Stop!

151
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,410
Don't move, drop the
gun, don't do anything stupid!

152
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,430
Ignore me, do your job.

153
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,460
Captain Wu is being
held hostage. They're heading up.

154
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,480
Wynn Macau.

155
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
The kids might...

156
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,430
Wynn, move quickly.

157
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,450
What are you waiting for?

158
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,480
Captain.

159
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,400
Wu Yaolei.

160
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,420
Fake.

161
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,450
Help me. Pull!

162
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,450
They're using parachutes.

163
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,470
Captain.

164
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Send reinforcements to Wynn Macau.

165
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,420
Go!

166
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,480
Captain, the elevator's been hacked.
How did you get down?

167
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,470
I jumped. Jumped?

168
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,490
Stay there!

169
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,420
Wynn Macau, rooftop.
You really jumped?

170
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,440
Attention, all units.

171
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,460
Send assistance to the new target location.

172
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,490
Wynn Macau. Assist in the capture.

173
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,516
I've contacted their head of
security, Mathew Tab.

174
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,540
Sit down.

175
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,560
They're heading to the
rooftop, call for help!

176
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:24,280
Call for help!

177
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,960
They must have a Plan-B,
warn Tab to be cautious.

178
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,410
It's not that simple.

179
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,430
What?

180
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,460
What do you mean?

181
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,480
How could they disappear
just like that from all the cameras?

182
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,500
That's what they do.

183
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,430
You're all tangled up.

184
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,450
Where are they? They're at the hotel.

185
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,480
Xin, the police have arrived. So quickly.

186
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,500
The Fort route is dead. Take the Ster route.

187
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,420
Why did you let them run?
They didn't run, they flew.

188
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,450
15 seconds. Ready for
Ster. I need the location.

189
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,470
Searching.

190
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Find them, quickly!

191
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,420
What happened? Not us.

192
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,440
Why are all my cameras? The Wynn CCTV
was remotely disabled.

193
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,470
Everyone, move quickly. Spread out, stay alert.

194
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,930
As long as they're here,
they can't hide their faces.

195
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,420
Everyone,

196
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,840
activate your body cameras.

197
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,860
Focus on any faces you encounter.

198
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,490
Du Ping, manually operate S.P.A.I.S.

199
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,516
Run facial recognition on all
images captured by body cameras.

200
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,540
Okay. Find them without guest entry records,

201
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,560
starting with area staff.

202
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,480
Stay off camera.

203
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,510
Or we're screwed.

204
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,430
I'm in.

205
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,460
Tell me where you are,

206
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,480
I'll handle it from here.

207
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
The king is moving.

208
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,430
Turn around.

209
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,450
Locker room, change clothes.

210
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,480
Excuse me, sir.

211
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
Sir!

212
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,420
Alpha 2 took the MCS1 elevator to the Ground Floor.

213
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,450
Ray. Turn around.

214
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,470
Move the cart to 10 o'clock.

215
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,400
Attention all units. The
suspects might change their disguise.

216
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,420
Stay focused, keep searching.

217
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,440
Height 175cm, slightly long hair,

218
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,870
black and white hooded
baseball jacket,

219
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,396
dark camouflage cargo pants
backpack. He's headed to the cafeteria.

220
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,420
Xin, you're exposed.

221
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,440
Feng, cover that face. Help Xin.

222
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,460
Yes, sir.

223
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,490
Song, the man who just passed.

224
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,410
Now.

225
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,440
He's not on the guest entry list. What?

226
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,460
There. That's him!

227
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,480
I'll handle this one.

228
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,510
Song, chase the other guy.

229
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,430
Sorry. Song, clean the lens.

230
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,460
Pursue that one. Go!

231
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,480
Hurry!

232
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
[MAIN KITCHEN]

233
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,430
Sorry.

234
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,450
Where is he?

235
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,480
The Wynn Prosperity Tree lobby is crowded.

236
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
WYNN PROSPERITY TREE

237
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,420
I thought the show was after 12.

238
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,450
If there's a system upgrade,
they test the show in the morning.

239
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,470
Find them, spread out!

240
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
Be alert, stay focused.

241
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,420
There.

242
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,440
They're disguising as police.
They're posing as police!

243
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,470
Checkmate.

244
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,490
Damn it! Bastard!

245
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,520
Bastard!

246
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,540
Everything's gone. 500 million!

247
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,560
Not a penny left!

248
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,490
Crypto is impossible to trace!

249
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,510
You useless cops!

250
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
They hacked us and
infiltrated the CCTV system.

251
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,460
So... Without Skyeye,

252
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,486
we can't tackle
crime anymore, right?

253
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,410
Before we had all this technology,

254
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,430
how did the police do their job?

255
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,460
It's my fault.

256
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,480
Next time I'll catch
them. Even if there's a next time,

257
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,406
they'll likely outsmart
our every move.

258
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,430
Then tell me...

259
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,456
what are we supposed to do? If
they stop now,

260
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,480
what's our breakthrough?

261
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,400
Sorry, sir. What's the status

262
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,420
of the cyber division?

263
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,450
[Don't be discouraged, it's not your fault they got away]
We've set intrusion points and code bugs,

264
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,470
but there's no progress
on backtracking.

265
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,400
To catch a cunning fox,

266
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,420
we need an experienced hunter.

267
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,440
Are you suggesting we call Wong again?

268
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,470
I know he was your old boss.

269
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,490
But now it's the era of A.I. tracking.

270
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
And they've already skinned its weaknesses.

271
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,440
There are many defects in
the network and CCTV equipment,

272
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,466
but S.P.A.I.S. is flawless. Stop
S.P.A.I.S., learn from real operations.

273
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,490
Do you let your phone
take charge of your tasks?

274
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,510
It's not about bringing a fossil!

275
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,540
It could improve the police's image. Captain.

276
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,460
I don't care if we use
a fossil or a Spice Girl.

277
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,480
Find them. Capture them.

278
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,510
Do your job.

279
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,430
Oh my, Guoguo,

280
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,460
have you ever seen Wong's file?

281
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,480
He's amazing.

282
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,400
A lot of praise.

283
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,430
A champion of any model of Special Operations.

284
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,450
A champion in hand-to-hand
combat within the police.

285
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,480
5 years in a row!

286
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
Skilled in firearms, surveillance,

287
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,420
infiltration, intelligence gathering.

288
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,450
He went undercover in drug cartels

289
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,470
and human organ trafficking syndicates.

290
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,500
Controlled, straightforward actions.

291
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,420
Expert at blending into his surroundings.

292
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,440
Hobbies...

293
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,470
Creating code calls.

294
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:58,490
It states here that one
major mistake in his career is

295
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,420
a personal mistake that resulted in

296
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,440
his partner's death.

297
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,460
Write which dog
pees or poops first.

298
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,490
Is it really him?

299
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,410
Hi.

300
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,440
Have you found it? Not yet.

301
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,460
Everyone else in
the field is handling big cases

302
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,480
and I don’t know what I’m doing.

303
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,410
Observing someone who’s
already retired? Patience.

304
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,430
Maybe the captain is watching you.

305
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,460
Maybe we're not ready for field duty.

306
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,480
I’ll get back to you later.

307
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
Practice observing an old guy like me?

308
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,430
Try repeating?

309
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,450
Why are you following me?

310
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,480
You’ve got the wrong person.

311
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,400
You don’t recognize me?

312
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,420
No.

313
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,450
Do you need something?

314
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:45,470
You’re not following me with your jacket inside out?

315
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,500
Can you sit somewhere else?

316
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,420
Sorry. It’s fine.

317
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,440
At 14:23, you reached your first target,

318
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,470
the pet shop.

319
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,490
So far, you’ve
been tailing me for 4 hours 17 minutes.

320
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,420
You changed your clothes 3 times,

321
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
and stopped 9 times to take notes.

322
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,460
One of your colleagues helped you on the bus.

323
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,490
Just looking around. Sorry.

324
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,510
Isn’t it true, He Qiuguo?

325
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,440
That expression accidentally
reveals you.

326
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,460
You remember me.

327
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,480
Uncle Wong. We haven’t
met since I was 8 years old.

328
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,410
I heard you joined the unit

329
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,430
and inherited your father's badge number.

330
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,460
He must be proud.

331
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,480
How did you know I was at the pet store earlier?

332
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,500
I had some clues.

333
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,430
First,

334
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,450
never throw away your notes.

335
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,480
Second, when walking the dog, leaving work, and taking the bus,

336
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,500
none of it was accurate.

337
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,520
The sequence of the dogs peeing and pooping was all mixed up.

338
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,450
Which was the sixth dog to poop?

339
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,470
Al Paca-paca, the poodle.

340
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
Maybe I was mistaken if I didn't pick it up.

341
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,420
It confuses my memory if I pick up that note.

342
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,440
Not bad.

343
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,470
You said my colleague was on the bus.

344
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,490
Why did you say that? Oh, I get it.

345
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,520
This is not a drill.

346
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,440
You're checking

347
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,460
if I'm still sharp.

348
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:47,490
The two of you followed me for 4 hours with such skill.

349
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,510
What made you confident?

350
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,440
MACAU JUDICIAL POLICE

351
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,880
Long time no see, Officer Wong.

352
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,910
This is Inspector Wu Yaolei.

353
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,430
Let me handle it. No.

354
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,460
You call yourself the police? No wonder I felt that old man touching me.

355
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,480
You seem proud.

356
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
So a work partner

357
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,430
who died on duty...

358
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,450
Was that your father?

359
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,480
Step back.

360
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,400
This is the footage we collected at the scene.

361
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,420
This video is Wynn's recording
before the hackers turned it off.

362
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,450
Please play the last 15 seconds.

363
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,470
Play it again.

364
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,400
Once more.

365
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,420
Stop!

366
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,440
How can you see them?
They peeked at the camera when entering.

367
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,470
They must have done
reconnaissance beforehand.

368
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,496
and knew the camera locations.
So, why did they peek?

369
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,520
To check if the camera was still on.

370
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,560
Once the camera was off,
they changed their disguise.

371
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,460
Isn't that right?

372
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,410
Xiwang.

373
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,440
Is the old man upset about the change in plan?

374
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,460
What do you think?

375
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,480
Go calm him down.

376
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:38,410
Adoptive dad... we're
all back safely.

377
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,430
Tense day, huh?

378
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,460
I can explain.

379
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,480
You nearly jeopardized everyone.

380
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,500
That wasn't part of the plan.

381
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,430
But our mission is done.

382
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,450
With a bonus, no less.

383
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,480
What bonus?

384
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,500
I only see mistakes!

385
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,540
All these years,
I've never been caught on camera.

386
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,450
Now I have

387
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:06,470
you useless one!
It's fine, I'll handle it.

388
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,500
You're useless too!

389
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,420
Let go.

390
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,440
Let us decide this time.

391
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,470
Let go?

392
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,490
Release it.

393
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,420
Could you tell me

394
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,440
what I should be afraid of now?

395
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,460
Besides, you wouldn't understand.

396
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:59,490
Let me tell you what you should fear.

397
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,410
Adoptive father.

398
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,440
Adoptive father, this is our fault.

399
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,460
For decades, not
a single photo of me.

400
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,480
That changed lilac , and smiles 

401
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,510
That changed because of
you idiots. Don't be mad.

402
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,430
That's more than 10 billion HKD.

403
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,460
With this This wealth 

404
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,480
Silent.

405
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,400
That tall man.

406
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,430
The lightning rod is changing its clothes.

407
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,450
Look at the monitor. Lightning Rod.

408
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,480
Remember its features.

409
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,540
This person, gritting
his teeth. Number 2, number 2.

410
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,420
Found the one with earrings.
Yes, that's him.

411
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:58,450
grim.

412
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,470
On-screen up again some 

413
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,500
Lightning Rod 3

414
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,520
is not very clear. I have
a clearer picture here!

415
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,540
Good, very good.

416
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,570
Cute Face number 2, wearing a small mustache.

417
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,796
Got... I found Cute Face number 3.

418
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,420
The one crouching. He changed disguise.
How many must sop socks). assemble tribe does gale moletrienour.

419
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,440
Sir, I think this one
is... Cute Face number 4.

420
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,460
I’ve seen this coat somewhere before.

421
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,490
Someone gave shepherded it to him.

422
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,510
Everyone listen up! There's one more person.

423
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,540
Send everything you
find to the main screen.

424
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,560
Yes, sir.

425
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,480
Police. Police.

426
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,510
Sorry.

427
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,430
Xiwang.

428
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,460
You saved my life once.

429
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,480
I truly appreciate this life.

430
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,400
I don't want
anything to happen to you.

431
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,430
Understood?

432
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:37,450
Understood.

433
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,480
We are with inline with you

434
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,500
life or death.

435
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,420
I don't want to die.

436
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:56,450
I want us all to enjoy our lives.

437
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,470
Ms. Sun, the coffee line in the lobby,

438
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,500
photographed this image that afternoon.

439
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,420
She is very likely the fifth person at Wynn.

440
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,440
Do we know her identity?

441
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,470
Sorry sir, not yet.

442
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:18,490
At the end of the '80s,

443
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,520
there was an international fugitive
formerly Special Forces

444
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,540
known as "The Shadow".

445
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,460
He served in the elite assassination squad.

446
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,490
During the war, he disguised

447
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,510
to infiltrate military and political targets.

448
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,540
Victims were killed load intended

449
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,460
And he always escaped.

450
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,280
Later, flew here to
seek greater fortune.

451
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,410
He planned more than dozens of bank robberies
and evaded 3 hunters

452
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,430
before disappearing without a trace in 1999.

453
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,460
This man might be the Shadow.

454
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,480
Coming out of retirement.

455
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,500
I remember him.

456
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,430
What's your next move?

457
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:52,456
This photo isn't sufficient
for facial recognition.

458
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,480
We're planning to add manpower
for a thorough sweep.

459
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,400
Area?

460
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,420
We have several images
of his accomplice's vehicles.

461
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,450
All were taken in the Old Town area.

462
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,470
That's a large area.

463
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,500
I suggest a two-pronged approach.

464
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,420
Conduct an open sweep
for diversion,

465
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,440
while sending in secret surveillance teams.

466
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:10,470
Officer Wong.

467
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,490
There are no more secret surveillance teams.

468
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,420
No more?

469
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,440
With today's surveillance network
and A.I.,

470
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,460
traditional secret surveillance teams

471
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,490
are almost unnecessary.

472
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,510
Small recommendations
for field monitoring.

473
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,440
You should use officers
who are least conspicuous.

474
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,460
Preferably ones not 
seen by the suspect.

475
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,600
Officer Wong, why don't you help us
form a temporary team?

476
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:43,410
An impromptu secret team
formed at the last minute

477
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:49,430
won't be as effective

478
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,460
as a comprehensive approach.

479
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,480
Guoguo. Stay on your course out there.

480
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,400
Guoguo. Stay on your path out there.

481
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:08,430
Leave the arrest to us.

482
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:09,450
Remember that.

483
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,480
Guguo can show off as much as he likes.

484
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,400
I'm just worried that showing off
might make him arrogant

485
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,420
and let them escape again.

486
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:22,450
How can someone so
small become a police officer?

487
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,470
His father was a police officer.

488
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,400
Doesn't he know he's just a symbolic child?

489
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,420
Not even a smile.

490
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,440
What's it to you if I'm a cop?

491
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:36,470
I earned myu Rank our police commonwealth.

492
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:38,490
Rude!

493
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,420
Don't forget, it was you idiots
who let them escape.

494
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,440
Come on, I'm the suspect. Arrest me. Come on!

495
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,460
the field agent

496
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:16,510
Come on! Arrest him.

497
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,440
In a place like the detective unit, people
might respect you with a small fight.

498
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,460
They will protect you out there.

499
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,480
In this place, no one believes

500
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,670
a woman can be
the first to breach the door.

501
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,430
The first can also get shot.

502
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,460
So what?

503
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,480
I'm not afraid to die. But
they don't want you to die.

504
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,400
My life isn't their business.

505
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,430
They really care
about the lives of colleagues.

506
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,450
No one considers me a colleague.

507
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,480
Old friend...

508
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,400
Guoguo has grown up.

509
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,420
He's just like you.

510
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:16,450
But I know he's not happy with the unit.

511
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,470
Someone who gets angry easily

512
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,500
can cause himself trouble

513
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,520
while on duty in the field.

514
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,540
Don't move! Police!

515
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:36,470
Don't worry. I'll take care of him.

516
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,420
I will do it.

517
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,440
I'll train the undercover team.

518
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,460
Let's catch him.

519
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:40,410
How considerate of Captain
Wu to send so many.

520
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,440
Thank you. Goodbye.

521
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,060
You look like a policeman.

522
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,480
Thank you.

523
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:03,410
We're dealing with an old fox.

524
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,430
An ancient thief. That's why

525
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,460
I'm going to train you
to become ancient hunters.

526
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,480
Let's go.

527
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,500
During surveillance,

528
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,530
develop the instinct
to observe and remember.

529
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,450
A glance is all you get.

530
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,480
Focus on key points.

531
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,400
Remember distinctive and permanent features.

532
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,420
I'm holding my hip.

533
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,450
Which two fingers are in my belt?

534
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,470
Left index. Right middle finger.

535
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,400
One surveillance team is an entity.

536
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,420
It needs every member

537
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,440
to complete one mission.

538
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,470
Let's move out.

539
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,490
Guoguo.

540
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,420
Come in.

541
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,440
Starting today, you must sop up into this city.

542
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,460
So theory becomes defaulted to action.

543
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:59,490
Doghead calls inline Animal Paradise.

544
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:00,510
Officer Wong,

545
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,540
what did you say? Doghead.

546
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,560
 Econ accord....Hath Arth. That mentions.

547
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,480
Unit Amity on location.

548
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,510
MONITORING DAY 01

549
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:08,930
I'll give alias you pipeline.

550
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,960
Liu, you're Al Paca-paca.

551
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,980
Can I ask for another name?

552
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,400
I'll shorten it. Alpaca.

553
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,430
Alright.

554
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,450
Wanwan... you're Tofu.

555
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,480
Yang Zhiwei... Rice Noodles.

556
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,500
Ting... Pudding.

557
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,420
Sun Xu... Potsticker.

558
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:25,450
Liao Qihang... Eggy.

559
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:27,470
Qiao Weidong... Lucky.

560
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,500
Song Keyu...

561
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,520
Fat Bun.

562
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,446
Isn't that teasing on body
shape? That's local specialty.

563
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,470
This is the food squad.

564
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:38,490
Better than my old unit.

565
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,520
He Qiuguo...

566
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,440
Little Flower Pinky.

567
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,460
Can I change it? Remove the "Little."

568
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:46,490
Then also remove "Flower."

569
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:55,410
Be patient.

570
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,440
You are my secret weapon.
It's like I trust you.

571
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,460
It's okay.

572
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,480
I'm used to being on the bench.

573
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,510
Boss, how much is this?

574
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:12,110
Where did you get this? Not your
business. Pay him and send him away.

575
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,460
Hey...

576
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,480
Don't stare at them like they're suspects.

577
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,400
Pull over.

578
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,430
Are you really here?

579
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:40,450
You've been to the same place
three times

580
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,480
wearing the same clothes using the
same hand and way to drink.

581
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,400
Your drink

582
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:48,420
is always the same amount. I'm
worried you'll need to pee.

583
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,450
Dehydration can also kill you.

584
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:52,470
Drink.

585
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,400
SURVEILLANCE DAY 03

586
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,420
SURVEILLANCE DAY 12

587
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,440
There's 10 billion at stake.

588
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,910
Once we get it,
we're set for life.

589
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,490
It's just this once.

590
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,520
That's what you all think, isn't it?

591
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,440
Money isn't everything.

592
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,460
Freedom is everything.

593
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:39,490
Different times,

594
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:41,510
different games.

595
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,440
If I let you plan

596
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,460
the next mission...

597
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,480
Do you understand what you're doing?

598
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:11,410
Simon!

599
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,430
Dad!

600
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:18,460
Dad! Xiwang!

601
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,480
You've grown up. Come here, come here.

602
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,400
Thank you, Dad.

603
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:30,430
Dad will be going away for a while.

604
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,450
Take care of your siblings.

605
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,480
I'll come back to you all.

606
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,400
Duan holds crypto
worth 1.5 billion USD.

607
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,420
The server location has been found.

608
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:52,450
We've got the decryption key,
but the digital vault is hard to access.

609
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,950
Simon is hiding in the orphanage,
making plans now.

610
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,400
A good place to hide.

611
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,420
It holds a lot of memories.

612
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,440
I know you're all
tired, but stay focused.

613
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:21,470
Don't want coffee? Go buy some.

614
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:23,490
Do I look tired to you?

615
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,420
Have you ever wondered

616
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,440
about killing me?

617
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,460
Then you could share my part.

618
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:37,490
How could we, Foster Dad?

619
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:40,410
Besides, I'm already old.

620
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,440
I'm just a hindrance to you.

621
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,460
Right?

622
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,480
Why did you say

623
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:51,510
I'm your secret weapon?

624
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:01,430
Are you gaslighting me? (manipulating me)

625
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,460
Gas what?

626
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,480
If anyone intended
to do that, I'd kill them.

627
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,400
The knife's already in your hand.

628
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,430
You think I didn't see that?

629
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:17,450
Am I less skilled? You think
I need special treatment too?

630
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,480
No, you have no issues.

631
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,400
You don't need special treatment.  

632
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,420
When there's a knife in your hand...  

633
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:29,450
don't blink.  

634
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:33,470
Be firm,  

635
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,400
or the shave won't be clean.  

636
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:45,420
So why is everyone on the field  

637
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,440
and I'm sitting here bringing you coffee?  

638
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:50,470
Do you want to... Yes.  

639
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:53,490
I do want to.  

640
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,420
But I need you here right now.  

641
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,440
Be my monitoring partner.  

642
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:12,460
That's an order.  

643
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:18,490
Yes, sir.  

644
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:22,410
Bro,  

645
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,440
if Xin hadn't held the old man back,  

646
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,460
he could have stabbed me.  

647
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,480
He really intended to kill me.  

648
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:38,410
Is it really that good?  

649
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:40,430
Just some lunch meat with egg noodles.  

650
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:42,460
Is your food better than a restaurant's?  

651
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,480
When I was your age,  

652
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,400
all I thought about was  

653
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:50,430
how to stay alive on the battlefield.  

654
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,450
I envy you all  

655
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,480
who can dream of anything  

656
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,400
and dare to dream of anything.  

657
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,420
All I want is a peaceful life  

658
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:04,450
with all my brothers.  

659
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,470
Not scattered like now.  

660
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,400
Over the years, to protect me,  

661
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:14,420
You sacrificed your time
with your brothers.

662
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,440
Since the day we met,
you protected me.

663
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:20,470
When all those police were chasing me,

664
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:22,490
I couldn't believe

665
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,420
a little beggar like you

666
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,440
would save me.

667
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,460
Then you risked your life

668
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:33,490
to keep that bankrupt orphanage
alive.

669
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:35,510
Without you, we'd have starved.

670
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,440
Eat mine too.

671
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:52,460
Of all the children,
I love you the most.

672
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,480
Because you're just like me.

673
00:46:57,410 --> 00:46:59,410
Simon is more like you.

674
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:03,430
If so...

675
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,460
he could be very dangerous.

676
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,480
Eggy and Tofu, your date is over.

677
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,500
Change clothes and head to Point E.

678
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:19,430
Pudding. Change clothes.

679
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:21,450
Point B.

680
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,480
Fat Bun, Point A.

681
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,400
Something feels
off lately.

682
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,420
Stay away for a while.

683
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:40,450
I can take care of myself.

684
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:57,470
MONITORING DAY 12

685
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,400
MONITORING DAY 15

686
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,420
Return to the car. Call the police.

687
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,440
I'm the police.

688
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:23,470
Help!

689
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:25,490
Hey, leave them alone!

690
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,520
Go away!

691
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:30,440
You're quite sweet, miss.

692
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,460
Who are you?

693
00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:59,490
Go away!

694
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,410
Let's go.

695
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,440
Move!

696
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,460
System shutdown.

697
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,480
Are you aware you're on a mission?

698
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:32,490
Protecting civilians is a police
officer's duty. At the right place and time.

699
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:35,430
You're on an active mission.

700
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,460
What mission? Lunch Operation for Officer Wong?

701
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,480
Sorry, I failed the mission.

702
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,400
Listen carefully.

703
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:43,430
You're on a secret surveillance mission.

704
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:45,450
Don't get caught,
no matter what.

705
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,480
I didn't leak anything.
But you want to take your badge!

706
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,400
If Shadow sees that,
it's over. And where is he?

707
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,420
We've been roaming for weeks.

708
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:56,050
It's time for me to do real work.
This is real work!

709
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:06,470
It's only been 2 weeks.

710
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,500
Do you know how long
our longest mission lasted?

711
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:12,420
8 months!

712
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,440
I know.

713
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:20,470
8 months.

714
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:22,490
So what?

715
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,420
What happened?

716
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,600
My dad was killed because of you!
The drug dealer escaped.

717
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:32,460
You know I didn't see him
for over a year before he died?

718
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:51,490
That was my fault.

719
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:54,410
I...

720
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,440
You know what I did that day?

721
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:00,460
I did what you did.

722
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,480
Cute kid.

723
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:07,410
I have bubble balloons here.

724
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:09,430
Like bubble balloons? Yes.

725
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,460
Let's play inside the van, shall we?

726
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,480
We have lots of
toys inside. Want to?

727
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,400
What? Get lost. Put the kid down.

728
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:28,430
Who are you? Put the child down!

729
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:31,450
Police.

730
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,480
Don't move!

731
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,500
What's the matter? Don't move!

732
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,420
Let me see your badge.

733
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:39,450
Police! Don't move!

734
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:08,470
My negligence

735
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,500
caused your father's death.

736
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:18,420
But you saved the child.

737
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,440
No.

738
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:24,470
The child abductor
escaped during the commotion.

739
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:30,490
Did they find the child?

740
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,420
I don't know.

741
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,440
As police officers,

742
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:50,460
we must stay rational.

743
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:52,490
Follow discipline.

744
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:54,510
Execute orders.

745
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,440
Better regret

746
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,460
than make a mistake.

747
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,480
Because that's our duty.

748
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:01,430
Possible sighting of
Shadow. Rua de Oeste Market.

749
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:02,460
Blue sweater jacket

750
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,480
Gray pants. Wears a brown beret hat.

751
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,900
Maybe wearing glasses.

752
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:07,430
Everyone, change clothes!

753
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:09,450
Prepare to identify them.

754
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,480
All units, attention.

755
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,500
Shadow spotted. Monitor the market.

756
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,520
Gemas Unit on the way.

757
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:21,450
Alpaca, Potsticker, east.

758
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:22,870
Eggy, Tofu, west.

759
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,400
Lucky, Rice Roll, south.

760
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:25,420
Pudding, Fat Bun, north.

761
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,440
Shadow may have seen you before.

762
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:29,470
A professional like them won't forget.

763
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:31,490
They'll be alert for the second time

764
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,520
and become suspicious.

765
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:34,540
Maintain a 2-unit distance.

766
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:37,460
Pinky.

767
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:41,490
Identify them closely.

768
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:44,410
They haven't seen your face.

769
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:47,440
Field surveillance advice.

770
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,460
You must use the most inconspicuous officer
you can.

771
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,600
Preferably someone the suspect hasn't
seen before.

772
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:59,410
Go ahead.

773
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:18,430
Slowly.

774
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:20,460
Keep your distance.

775
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,480
Doghead calling Animal Paradise.

776
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,500
Gemas Unit on site.

777
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:28,530
Alpaca.

778
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:30,550
Approach the fruit stall in the west.

779
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,480
Walk slowly.

780
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,500
Don't rush.

781
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,420
Our mission is to identify the target.

782
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:42,450
Make sure Shadow doesn't escape.

783
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:46,470
Calm down. Act natural.

784
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,400
He's a professional.

785
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:50,420
Don't be careless.

786
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,440
Potsticker, exit via the east. Okay.

787
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:58,470
Fat Bun, standby near the bridge. Okay.

788
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:05,990
Pudding, don't get too close.

789
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:07,420
Keep your distance.

790
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,440
Alpaca. Can you identify him?

791
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:13,460
Can't do it.

792
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:14,490
Can't see his face.

793
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:16,510
Can't be certain.

794
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,440
We might be able to see his face.

795
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,460
Eggy, Shadow might have
seen you in Aoxing.

796
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,480
Don't turn around.

797
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:46,410
Tofu, well done.

798
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:48,430
Pinky, it's your turn now.

799
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:54,460
Be careful.

800
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,480
I'm going to approach him.

801
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,400
Pinky, you might get exposed.

802
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:11,430
I know. I have an idea.

803
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:47,450
It's definitely him.

804
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,480
Confirmed.

805
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,500
Lower your hands.

806
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,420
Don't move the camera.

807
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:19,450
All units, confirmed
positive identification of Shadow.

808
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:21,476
Cute Unit, change clothes and standby.

809
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,500
Keep your distance.

810
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,520
Everyone, good job.

811
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,440
Target has been confirmed.

812
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:33,470
All units, do not
enter the 3-block perimeter.

813
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:36,490
I repeat, do not approach the target area.

814
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,520
Attention, no sirens.

815
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,440
The target has entered the blind spot.

816
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:50,460
Lucky, it's your turn.

817
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:52,490
Potsticker, tail him.

818
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:55,410
Don't get too close.

819
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,440
That bastard won't get far.

820
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,460
Shadow is heading to Changning Apartments.

821
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,486
The blocks are connected inside.
There are hundreds of apartments.

822
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:09,310
If we don't get the apartment number,
we won't have another chance.

823
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:24,430
Shadow is in Block C, Unit 1.

824
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:27,140
There are no cameras inside the building.
We'll lose him in the elevator.

825
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,480
Pull over.

826
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:29,900
Cute Unit. They're too far.

827
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:30,930
Cute Unit, respond.

828
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:31,956
I’m too far to chase.

829
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:33,780
Potsticker, don't follow.

830
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,400
Eggy, don't follow.
I'll go. Pinky can follow.

831
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:41,420
I'm going in.

832
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:58,450
Top floor.

833
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:16,470
What are you doing? Will you listen to your father or not?

834
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,500
What? Dating without my knowledge.

835
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,520
My friend caught you, you know.

836
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,440
Which floor?

837
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:29,470
I forgot something.

838
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:31,490
You two go ahead.

839
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:51,420
Dressing up now? Your dad knows
you can lose an earring

840
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,440
wearing those big headphones.
Seriously, don't bother me.

841
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:57,460
See this?

842
01:01:57,490 --> 01:01:59,490
Kids don't listen when they grow up.

843
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:01,510
They're only good at opposing their parents.

844
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,440
They grow up with their own thoughts.

845
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:09,460
What can a father do?

846
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:12,480
You're open-minded.
Otherwise, they'll start

847
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:14,510
hiding things from you.

848
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:24,430
Your Aunt Kandam says
that guy looks like an alpaca.

849
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:26,060
Is that why you're
hiding him from your dad?

850
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:28,480
Who? The guy you're dating.

851
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,900
What's wrong if he looks like an alpaca?

852
01:02:30,930 --> 01:02:32,930
Alpacas are cute.

853
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:35,450
He's actually handsome, you know?

854
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,480
It's been days.
Why did dad buy it?

855
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:40,620
Got camera signal. Everything's
the same once it hits the stomach.

856
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:43,420
Here.

857
01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:45,450
Want some?

858
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:50,470
Check his background. Fine.

859
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,400
Shadow's face has been acquired.

860
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:54,420
Caught on camera.

861
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,440
Why did he spit it out?

862
01:02:57,470 --> 01:02:59,710
The cleaner will
take care of it. See, it's fine.

863
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:02,490
Dad hopes you'll marry

864
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,520
into a wealthy family someday.

865
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:06,540
Ever seen wealthy in-laws

866
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,560
with uncultivated manners?

867
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:11,490
One rotten apple shouldn't
spoil the whole family.

868
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:13,510
Will dad act better?

869
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,440
Buy fresh fruit.

870
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:17,460
Dad saves money for you.

871
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:19,480
No more.

872
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:24,410
Goodbye.

873
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:34,430
So who's flirting with whom now?

874
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:36,460
None of your business, Dad.

875
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,640
Your temper is bad.
What does she see in you?

876
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,400
Keep moving.

877
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:44,430
My temper is good.

878
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:47,450
Now what? Follow me.

879
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:49,480
What's the sign? What's the deal?

880
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,500
Maybe she's right for me.

881
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:54,420
You're not serious, Dad.

882
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:56,450
Get the package. I'm
impressed by how nosy you are.

883
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:03,470
You bought a lot of stuff.

884
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,400
Police.

885
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:17,420
Close the door!

886
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,680
We need this apartment,
please step aside. Police business.

887
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:26,470
8th floor.

888
01:04:43,490 --> 01:04:45,490
No. 802, got it.

889
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,520
Shadow lives in Channing's apartment.

890
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:50,440
Block C, Unit 1, No. 802. Info confirmed.

891
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:22,460
Pick it up.

892
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:41,490
What's that noise?

893
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:43,510
Popping bubble wrap?

894
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:45,540
Is this OCD?

895
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:57,460
This can't be broken.
No wonder it's torn.

896
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,480
Weird.

897
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:06,510
This is all wrong.

898
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:34,430
In the past, Shadow always
disappeared after missions

899
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:36,460
and stayed hidden for a while.

900
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,480
He's a man of principle.

901
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,500
This time, he broke
his own protocol.

902
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:42,430
What happened?

903
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:44,450
If I'm not mistaken,

904
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,480
my guess is

905
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,400
we've scared him.

906
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:50,420
Whatever he wants to play,

907
01:06:50,450 --> 01:06:52,450
/log_series/ just go timelines consS/,log_1sS/,log_2sS/,log_dr,log_emmer/,log_stormy/./log_series/ consS/,log_consS/,log_sta/"

908
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:01,470
Finally stopped buying rotten apples?

909
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,500
What a coincidence.

910
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:07,420
How much is it?

911
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,440
$3.70. The price has gone up.

912
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:11,470
It's okay.

913
01:07:11,490 --> 01:07:13,490
20 cents.

914
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,020
Everything is more breaking down now./e have log_emmet/,log_emmet/,log_town/.

915
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:17,040
This one. Thanks.

916
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:20,460
That stand is cheaper.

917
01:07:20,490 --> 01:07:22,490
Are you kidding? They're worse.

918
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:24,510
Nothing's fresh.

919
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,440
I mean the fish stall behind it.

920
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:30,460
That's cheap.

921
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,480
You're right.

922
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:34,510
Especially since the owner's father is friendly.

923
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:36,530
10 dollars.

924
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,460
It's a pity

925
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,480
he passed AND ss_suddenly pass log_emmet/,log_emmet/, whose log_emmet/.

926
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:41,500
Heart attack.

927
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:43,530
Asthma.

928
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:48,450
Your daughter has grown court big.
Doesn't she want to move then? 

929
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,480
Her mother left me because of my gambling habit.

930
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,500
After her mom died from illness,###controller log_emmet/,###controller log_emmet/.###controller log_emmet/")"###controller log_emmet/@controller log_motivate@",###controller log_emmet/."###controller log_emmet/,###controller log_emmet)###controller log_emmet;,sleep###.""/log_controller/,###controller log_emmet/.,###controller log_emmet/,/"###controller log_emmet")###controller log HOUSE marks###")###-}controller log emmet/log_emmet/log_emmet/,###log_emmet/./log_emmet".###controller log_emmet."###controller log_emmet-./###controller log_motivate///controller_tracks/log_controller/,###controller log_motivate/,###controller log_vc./log_emmet/,.###".).###controller log_motivate"`)###controller_skins//controller log_emmet/###logs/log_emmet/###logs/log_emmet/-log_emmet/log_emmet";,/###controller log_motivate/###controller log_motivate/###controller log_emmet)###controller_s";//controllers_log_emmet/log_emmet;./log_emmet/.###log_emmet-().###logs/log_emmet/"###-###log_motivate/###controller_leaks/log_emmet/,###controller_moblog_controller/motivate"//"log_emmet/###logs_log_emmet//###c/log_emmet/###controllers_log_emmet/###controllers_a_ triggers-particles_controller_emmet/log_emmet/log_emmet/./###log_emmet/,###controller/log_emmet.###controller;###log_emmet/./###log_emmet/-engagements_motivate_examples/log_emmet_controller/log_emmet/home_action_logs/log_emmet_controllers/,###controller emmet_log_motivate_s/control_log_emmet_motivate/motivate_log_emmet-

931
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,420
she moved in with me.  

932
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:00,450
Thanks.  

933
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:01,470
What are you doing?  

934
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,400
Planning to work at a casino?  

935
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:05,780
Selling fish isn't enough to pay
the bills. Offer grass carp.  

936
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,440
See this callus?  

937
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:12,470
It's from playing cards often
when I was young.  

938
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:14,490
I wanted to be the God of Gamblers. I didn't know  

939
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,520
that it was only in movies.  

940
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,440
I thought  

941
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:21,460
your calluses were from handling guns.  

942
01:08:21,490 --> 01:08:24,490
Never held a gun. But
held a chef's knife for 10 years.  

943
01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:27,410
If there's time. I'll
cook some dishes.  

944
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,440
Stop by  

945
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:31,460
and have a drink.  

946
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,480
That's funny.  

947
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:35,510
I was a chef abroad.  

948
01:08:35,530 --> 01:08:36,530
My teacher was from Hangzhou.  

949
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,560
I cooked delicious West Lake vinegar fish.  

950
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:41,480
How about today?  

951
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:45,400
Sure.  

952
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:47,430
I happen to have a bottle of Chilean wine,  

953
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:49,450
perfect with that dish.  

954
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,480
You bring the wine, I'll do the cooking.  

955
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:56,400
Come in.  

956
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:58,420
Please sit.  

957
01:08:58,450 --> 01:09:00,450
I'll put this in the fridge.  

958
01:09:07,470 --> 01:09:09,470
What's he doing? Checking for dust.  

959
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,500
To know they just moved in.  

960
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:16,420
You won't avoid it.  

961
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:17,840
You might be a guest,

962
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:19,870
but you can't escape kitchen duties.

963
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:21,890
Show us your skills.

964
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,920
I can't wait.

965
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,440
How long have you been a chef?

966
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:28,460
More than 10 years.

967
01:09:29,490 --> 01:09:31,490
Is that the knife you're using?

968
01:09:49,410 --> 01:09:51,410
You're good with the knife.

969
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,440
I just enjoy

970
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:55,460
doing things right.

971
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,480
Do you have kids?

972
01:09:58,510 --> 01:09:59,510
I'm alone.

973
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:01,530
A lonely old man.

974
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:03,560
This is my own cooking.

975
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:09,480
Your daughter seems smart.

976
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,500
The scar on her forehead...

977
01:10:11,530 --> 01:10:13,530
what's it from?

978
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:22,450
Put your phone down.

979
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,480
Chat with our guest. Okay.

980
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,400
I'll go to the bathroom first.

981
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:33,420
If I had kids,

982
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:35,450
I'd also ban phones at the dining table.

983
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:43,470
Start cloning. What did you study?

984
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:44,500
Nursing.

985
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,520
Are you planning to be a nurse after graduation?

986
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,440
Maybe at a nursing home.

987
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:53,470
You're kind-hearted.

988
01:10:55,490 --> 01:10:57,490
How did you get hurt like that?

989
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,520
This one?

990
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:03,440
Grade 5.

991
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:05,460
Fighting with a girl.

992
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:08,490
Why fight?

993
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:10,510
There was a classmate
being bullied. I couldn't just stay silent.

994
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,440
But I never told until now.

995
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:18,460
Does your dad know? He couldn't possibly know.

996
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,480
That's strange.

997
01:11:22,510 --> 01:11:24,510
How so?

998
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:27,430
What did you say that she got hurt?

999
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:30,460
She fought back in 5th grade.

1000
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:31,480
1 against 5.

1001
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,500
Someone hit her with a bottle.

1002
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:40,430
I never told anyone.

1003
01:11:40,450 --> 01:11:42,450
Not even mom.

1004
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,480
You didn't tell her
because you didn't want her to worry.

1005
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:48,400
Even your teacher thought you hit a door.

1006
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:50,420
Right?

1007
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:54,450
Then how does dad know?

1008
01:11:59,470 --> 01:12:01,470
After our divorce,

1009
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,400
my debts

1010
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,420
made me plenty of enemies.

1011
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,440
Dad was worried they might harm you.

1012
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:14,470
Actually...

1013
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:16,490
dad was always near you.

1014
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:27,420
See?

1015
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,440
That's what a father does.

1016
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:38,460
Then why didn't dad help me?

1017
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:39,490
Help you?

1018
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:41,510
Remember what you did to those kids?

1019
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:42,540
It was a mess.

1020
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,460
I was afraid to intervene. Praise me.

1021
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,480
I defended someone.

1022
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:48,510
You... What?

1023
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:50,530
You committed a murder. You must be kidding.

1024
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:53,460
Dad made me embarrassed.

1025
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,400
How did it go?

1026
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:19,430
Go ahead.

1027
01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:25,450
Thank you.

1028
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,480
For what?

1029
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,400
For protecting us.

1030
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:39,420
There are things

1031
01:13:39,450 --> 01:13:41,450
that cannot be undone.

1032
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:46,470
The only thing I can
do for your father

1033
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,400
is watch over you.

1034
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:54,420
I know you've been worried about me all this time.

1035
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,440
You want to protect me.

1036
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:01,470
But I'm grown up.

1037
01:14:03,490 --> 01:14:05,490
I'll be fine.

1038
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:11,420
You're okay.

1039
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:14,440
Bro...

1040
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:16,460
if you fail,

1041
01:14:16,490 --> 01:14:18,490
then I'll take over next sop.

1042
01:14:19,410 --> 01:14:22,410
If we use your method, there's
no turning back for us.

1043
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:24,440
I just want

1044
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,460
to do something right.

1045
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:35,486
They have anti-tracker.
Must be that hacker.

1046
01:14:35,510 --> 01:14:37,510
Don't proceed.

1047
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:41,430
Did you check his background?

1048
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:46,460
Yes.

1049
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,480
Guoguo? Forget something?

1050
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,400
There's nothing to worry about.

1051
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:05,430
Maybe my worries are overblown.

1052
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:14,450
Do you sense anything wrong?

1053
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,480
I realize that

1054
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,500
you've grown up now.

1055
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:42,520
It's time to let go.

1056
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:20,450
Let's follow your plan.

1057
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:22,470
Okay. Do you understand what you're doing?

1058
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,400
I understand.

1059
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:22,420
That girl is not Guoguo.

1060
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,440
What do you mean? There's something
wrong with this camera.

1061
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:26,470
It's clearly not Qiuguo.

1062
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:33,490
Send help to Wong. He's in danger!

1063
01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:36,420
The police are coming. I'm leaving.

1064
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:09,440
I failed.

1065
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:11,460
I'll find another way.

1066
01:18:34,490 --> 01:18:35,490
Hey.

1067
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:37,510
Has Shadow made a move?

1068
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:39,540
No, still quiet.

1069
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:47,460
You were given a chance, Xiwang.

1070
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,480
Those kids

1071
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:55,410
did not tell Shadow

1072
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:57,430
that he's being watched.

1073
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:00,460
They know we're using
Shadow to track them,

1074
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,480
so we won't touch him.

1075
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:03,500
[Eliminate the target]

1076
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:05,530
[Forcefully seize the digital safe]

1077
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:08,450
[Your plan is crazy]

1078
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,480
Killing me and creating chaos

1079
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:13,400
will open the opportunity to release Shadow.

1080
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:16,420
After failing this time, they'll
look for another opportunity.

1081
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:20,250
[Including the US$30 million payment]

1082
01:19:20,470 --> 01:19:23,470
Their chance is also our opportunity.

1083
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:25,500
We must eradicate this gang of robbers

1084
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:26,520
once and for all.

1085
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:27,540
[At that price]

1086
01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:30,470
[no one will open
that vault for you]

1087
01:19:32,490 --> 01:19:34,490
[US$50 million]

1088
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:39,420
[Agreed]

1089
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,440
72 HOURS LATER

1090
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:53,460
Shadow is on the move.

1091
01:20:10,490 --> 01:20:12,490
Monitoring team, disperse.

1092
01:20:13,410 --> 01:20:15,410
Madam, it's the same taxi

1093
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,440
as the one at Aoxing.

1094
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:19,460
Sending photos to the monitoring team now.

1095
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:20,480
We are on alert.

1096
01:20:20,510 --> 01:20:22,510
Once the suspect's location
is locked, we're ready to go in.

1097
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:29,430
Target vehicle approaching our Headquarters.

1098
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:31,460
Are they surrendering?

1099
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,480
Doesn't look like it.

1100
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:43,400
Wait!

1101
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:45,430
Show that cabinet again.

1102
01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:53,450
Why is it still there?

1103
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,480
This can't be resolved.

1104
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,500
This is all wrong.

1105
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:05,420
Zoom in, show it again.

1106
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:13,450
What is that?

1107
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:15,470
Looks like Wong's van was hit.

1108
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:44,400
Officer Wong?

1109
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:46,420
Wong, can you hear?

1110
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,440
Wong, respond if you can hear.

1111
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:50,470
Officer Wong? Officer Wong?

1112
01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:52,490
Officer Wong? Guoguo?

1113
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:54,520
Their vehicle... broke in.

1114
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:56,540
Whose vehicle?

1115
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:07,460
Headquarters attacked?

1116
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:09,490
Madam, what's happening?

1117
01:22:17,410 --> 01:22:19,410
Du Ping, ready to move
the command unit. Yes, madam.

1118
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,440
Monitor, stay focused. Watch the target.

1119
01:22:21,460 --> 01:22:23,460
Watch every move of Shadow.

1120
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:33,480
Officer Wong.

1121
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:38,410
Someone's still alive.

1122
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:40,430
Finish them.

1123
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:19,460
His phone...

1124
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:20,480
Destroyed.

1125
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:22,500
The key to the puzzle
isn't numbers. It's positions.

1126
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:24,530
They're using Braille letters.
The bubble wrap is also Braille.

1127
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:27,450
Call Intelligence to decipher the message.

1128
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:29,480
Find out their plan.

1129
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,400
Get the phone, I'll intercept them. Hurry!

1130
01:23:47,420 --> 01:23:49,420
What is this place? Seems like
an old orphanage.

1131
01:23:50,450 --> 01:23:52,450
No other suspects in sight.

1132
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:55,476
Use thermal heat detection
to track Shadow.

1133
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,500
I need visual inside.

1134
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:09,420
Captain!

1135
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,440
Inside the orphanage!

1136
01:24:15,470 --> 01:24:16,470
Headquarters.

1137
01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:18,490
This is Alpaca. Can anyone hear?

1138
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,520
Command center?

1139
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:22,540
We've lost communication. Command center?

1140
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:51,460
Friends, get to work!

1141
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:22,490
Chop him up!

1142
01:25:53,410 --> 01:25:56,410
Do you know how many
police are house me Gillinger?

1143
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:58,440
200.

1144
01:25:58,460 --> 01:26:00,460
If I run, they'll kill me.

1145
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:03,480
So what did NB did you Domino?

1146
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:05,510
The fool who got caught

1147
01:26:05,530 --> 01:26:07,530
becomes the bait.

1148
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:10,460
Then I eliminate the biggest threat

1149
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:12,480
in the Police Union.

1150
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:15,400
That blinds the police.

1151
01:26:18,430 --> 01:26:21,430
Then I finish off that fool,

1152
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:25,450
and cut off police ears too Parsons too.

1153
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:29,480
 garn me the fool in my followers.

1154
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:35,400
But...

1155
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:38,420
first you have to make sure

1156
01:26:39,450 --> 01:26:41,450
what's necessary.

1157
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:44,470
You've grown sop now.

1158
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,500
Do you understand what you're doing?

1159
01:26:49,420 --> 01:26:51,420
Who do you think I and pr get?

1160
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,440
Kill him!

1161
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:07,470
Phone signal is blocked.

1162
01:27:07,490 --> 01:27:09,490
Find a satellite phone
to call for help.

1163
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,520
We'll buy time.

1164
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:40,440
There he ps closer!

1165
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:42,460
Have to kill him to get paid.

1166
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:12,990
Shadow sent a message in Braille.

1167
01:28:13,010 --> 01:28:14,716
Bubble wrap and sudoku all in Braille.

1168
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:16,740
Guoguo. Give that intel
to Madam Wang.

1169
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:22,460
Guoguo!

1170
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:07,480
Why did the police get here so fast?

1171
01:29:32,410 --> 01:29:34,410
Madam, we got this.

1172
01:30:18,430 --> 01:30:20,430
Foster father.

1173
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:25,460
I failed.

1174
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:26,480
I'll find another way.

1175
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:28,500
You've been given a chance, Xiwang.

1176
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:30,530
If we get caught by the police,

1177
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:32,550
what would the old man do?

1178
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:34,580
It's nobody's fault.

1179
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:36,400
Just

1180
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:38,420
carelessness and bad luck.

1181
01:30:40,450 --> 01:30:42,450
Simon's idea? My idea.

1182
01:30:55,470 --> 01:30:57,470
Still think you're not like me?

1183
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:04,400
Xiwang, what are you
doing? You don't understand

1184
01:31:05,420 --> 01:31:07,420
how dangerous this person is.

1185
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:17,440
Go!

1186
01:31:17,470 --> 01:31:19,470
This isn't part of the plan!

1187
01:31:23,490 --> 01:31:25,490
This old man has to die here

1188
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:29,420
so you can be safe. Go!
This isn't part of the plan!

1189
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:34,440
This is indeed my plan.

1190
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:41,460
I'm helping you one last time.

1191
01:31:43,490 --> 01:31:44,490
You want to die?

1192
01:31:44,510 --> 01:31:46,410
Simon's my brother.

1193
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:47,640
If he causes trouble...

1194
01:31:47,660 --> 01:31:49,660
it's my job to fix it.
I have no choice.

1195
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:55,480
Then I'll guide you to your path.

1196
01:31:57,410 --> 01:31:59,410
Foster father!

1197
01:32:00,430 --> 01:32:02,430
Your life

1198
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:04,460
also ends here.

1199
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:27,480
Ready yourself!

1200
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,400
He's a wolf.

1201
01:34:50,430 --> 01:34:52,430
We're the wolf pups.

1202
01:34:55,450 --> 01:34:57,450
He's our father.

1203
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,480
In my next life,

1204
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:06,400
I hope to be your biological son.

1205
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:13,420
Take care of them.

1206
01:36:13,450 --> 01:36:15,450
Take care of their family.

1207
01:36:17,470 --> 01:36:19,470
Yes, sir.

1208
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:37,400
Kandam, it's me.

1209
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:41,420
Gundam. Like a robot. What do we know?

1210
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,446
I just contacted Captain
Wu. Big explosion at the orphanage.

1211
01:36:45,470 --> 01:36:47,470
Shadow? Not quite sure.

1212
01:36:47,490 --> 01:36:49,490
But we've already
identified the attackers.

1213
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:51,520
On the surface, they
are private security

1214
01:36:51,540 --> 01:36:53,440
for VIP clients at the casino.

1215
01:36:53,460 --> 01:36:55,460
But they also moonlight
as mercenaries,

1216
01:36:55,490 --> 01:36:57,490
taking high-risk jobs on the dark web.

1217
01:36:57,510 --> 01:36:59,410
Alpaca contacted Evidence

1218
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:00,840
after receiving Pinky's message.

1219
01:37:00,860 --> 01:37:02,860
We'll soon receive
results thanks to him.

1220
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:07,480
That's Gordon D.

1221
01:37:09,410 --> 01:37:12,410
Why are Duan's HK$10 billion
in the police station's server?

1222
01:37:12,430 --> 01:37:15,436
Without the decryption key, the loot
can only be stored as digital evidence.

1223
01:37:15,460 --> 01:37:17,460
The only way to access the crypto wallet

1224
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:19,480
is by using its digital key,
activating the 12-word passphrase

1225
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:21,500
entered with nanosecond precision.

1226
01:37:22,430 --> 01:37:24,430
They've been here.

1227
01:37:27,450 --> 01:37:29,450
Madam, leave this to us.

1228
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:31,480
Be careful.

1229
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:34,800
We've received a report of
a robbery, the robbers just left.

1230
01:37:34,820 --> 01:37:36,820
4 men, early 20s.

1231
01:37:38,450 --> 01:37:40,450
They're the SWAT guys from earlier.

1232
01:37:40,470 --> 01:37:42,470
The perpetrator shut down the electricity

1233
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:44,500
to prevent us from remotely disabling the hacker.

1234
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:48,100
They need the local network
within range to access the server.

1235
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:49,440
What does that mean?

1236
01:37:49,470 --> 01:37:51,470
The hacker just got here.

1237
01:38:02,490 --> 01:38:04,490
We were wrong.

1238
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:06,420
Why were we wrong?

1239
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:08,440
The old man got himself
caught.

1240
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:11,460
Like an idiot.

1241
01:38:11,490 --> 01:38:13,490
He was outsmarted by the police.

1242
01:38:16,410 --> 01:38:18,416
The cop's house is too
clean. Not a single router.

1243
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:20,440
That's very strange.

1244
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:22,460
It's impossible that the old man didn't notice.

1245
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:25,480
But he's still playing along.

1246
01:38:26,410 --> 01:38:28,410
What are you trying to say?

1247
01:38:30,430 --> 01:38:32,430
I think

1248
01:38:32,460 --> 01:38:34,460
he actually kept

1249
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:36,480
the police off our trail.

1250
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:39,400
"Ghost Car" trap?

1251
01:38:42,430 --> 01:38:44,430
He's not that noble.

1252
01:38:44,450 --> 01:38:46,450
He's the most cunning,

1253
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:49,480
ruthless,

1254
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:51,500
and...

1255
01:38:56,420 --> 01:38:59,450
He's a father.

1256
01:39:03,470 --> 01:39:05,470
Calm down.

1257
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:07,500
Run first.

1258
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:09,520
Then we cry.

1259
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:40,440
We lost the SWAT vehicle in

1260
01:39:40,470 --> 01:39:42,470
the CCTV blind spot on
Calcada do Carmo street.

1261
01:39:42,490 --> 01:39:44,490
The robbers are likely
to escape tonight.

1262
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:46,520
Monitor every possible exit
route and all departure schedules.

1263
01:39:46,540 --> 01:39:47,540
Every route?

1264
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:49,560
That'll take a long time. We don't have time.

1265
01:39:49,590 --> 01:39:51,590
What should we do now?

1266
01:39:52,410 --> 01:39:55,410
Activate S.P.A.I.S. restore
analysis and command authority.

1267
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:57,440
Alright.

1268
01:39:57,460 --> 01:39:59,460
Have him study the robbers' old methods

1269
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:01,480
and predict their next moves.

1270
01:40:01,510 --> 01:40:03,510
Also show him their
latest methods.

1271
01:40:04,430 --> 01:40:06,430
If possible... Madam.

1272
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:08,460
Spice Girls got a clue. That fast?

1273
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:12,480
Suspect vehicle disappeared
in Calcada do Carmo.

1274
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:15,400
Within a 3 km radius, a black
van was caught on camera.

1275
01:40:15,430 --> 01:40:17,430
There's a 67% chance

1276
01:40:17,450 --> 01:40:19,450
the robbers switched to this van.

1277
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:21,480
There's an 82% chance the robbers

1278
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:23,500
are heading to Wynn Palace. Wynn? Wynn again?

1279
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:26,540
I said study, not to repeat old answers.

1280
01:40:28,450 --> 01:40:31,470
Don't move! Hands up!
Don't move!

1281
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:33,400
Don't move!

1282
01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:34,420
Put down the knife.

1283
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:36,440
Put down the knife!

1284
01:40:36,470 --> 01:40:37,470
Put it down! Put down the knife!

1285
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:39,490
Don't move!

1286
01:40:44,420 --> 01:40:48,440
Ting.

1287
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:51,490
Shadow is still alive.

1288
01:40:51,510 --> 01:40:53,410
Kneel! Hands on your head!

1289
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:55,460
Kneel! Hands on your head!

1290
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:57,480
Kneel!

1291
01:41:04,410 --> 01:41:06,410
Dad!

1292
01:41:14,430 --> 01:41:17,460
Kneel down! Hands on your head!

1293
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:19,480
Kneel down!

1294
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:25,400
Wynn Palace.

1295
01:41:27,430 --> 01:41:29,430
Take me there.

1296
01:41:29,450 --> 01:41:31,450
There's someone you haven't met yet.

1297
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:34,480
I'll inline.

1298
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:42,400
Spice Girl found a vehicle
relevant to a possible route

1299
01:41:42,420 --> 01:41:44,426
leading to suspicious individuals. [[BR]]]Is their identity suspicious?

1300
01:41:44,450 --> 01:41:45,650
No. A number of them.

1301
01:41:45,670 --> 01:41:47,470
Wynn has an art exhibition.

1302
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:49,500
All paintings are being flown
back to Paris tonight.

1303
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:52,420
Six Chinese personnel were Inline[[[ sop]]] into passenger list 2 days ago.

1304
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:55,446
And on the night of the last robbery,
Wynn also had artwork left behind.

1305
01:41:55,470 --> 01:41:57,470
This Spice Girl is talented.

1306
01:41:59,490 --> 01:42:01,490
WYNN PALACE

1307
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:19,720
Police. That fast?

1308
01:42:19,740 --> 01:42:21,740
Plan B.

1309
01:42:49,460 --> 01:42:51,460
Doghead here. Target X
may be in the laundry room.

1310
01:42:52,490 --> 01:42:54,490
Pinky, south door of the laundry room.

1311
01:42:54,510 --> 01:42:55,510
Golover.

1312
01:42:55,540 --> 01:42:57,540
Estimated time for Watch team?

1313
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:13,460
Leave him to us inline; you go.

1314
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:20,480
Pinky.

1315
01:43:20,510 --> 01:43:22,510
Target X has left the laundry room.

1316
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:25,446
Little Dog and Cute Face
" inline" demonstrating their skills.

1317
01:43:25,470 --> 01:43:27,470
I need to talk to them.

1318
01:43:27,490 --> 01:43:29,490
Trying to force them
to surrender. Surrender my foot!

1319
01:43:33,410 --> 01:43:36,410
Attention all units. Wynn Palace
South Lawn is crowded.

1320
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:38,440
Seems like there's an event tonight.

1321
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:15,460
Cancel that name.

1322
01:44:15,490 --> 01:44:17,490
This puppy
is mad at Psycho Cat.

1323
01:44:36,410 --> 01:44:38,410
Pinky to Doghead.

1324
01:44:38,430 --> 01:44:40,430
Talk, Pinky! I'm at the party.

1325
01:44:40,460 --> 01:44:41,660
I think he's here,

1326
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:43,680
but I can't find him. Stay calm.

1327
01:44:44,410 --> 01:44:46,410
Doghead to Animal Paradise.

1328
01:44:46,430 --> 01:44:48,430
Use Shadow's number to
call him. A.I. voice imitation?

1329
01:44:48,450 --> 01:44:50,450
Let the old man talk to him.

1330
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:55,480
Acknowledged.

1331
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:09,400
Foster dad?

1332
01:45:13,430 --> 01:45:15,430
Xiwang died in vain.

1333
01:45:20,450 --> 01:45:22,450
Tracking target X's phone now.

1334
01:45:22,470 --> 01:45:24,470
No anti-tracking.
He's not hiding anymore.

1335
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:26,500
Pinky. Focus.

1336
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:28,520
Observe people's reactions. Understood.

1337
01:45:29,450 --> 01:45:31,450
Simon,

1338
01:45:31,470 --> 01:45:33,470
the police are fishing for you.

1339
01:45:34,490 --> 01:45:36,490
If the police catch you today,

1340
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:38,520
I'll be very disappointed.

1341
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:41,440
Maybe I've already disappointed you.

1342
01:45:44,470 --> 01:45:46,470
You have a good plan today.

1343
01:45:47,490 --> 01:45:48,490
I like it.

1344
01:45:48,510 --> 01:45:51,410
Thank you, foster dad. But...

1345
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:53,440
anyone who understands
what they're doing

1346
01:45:53,460 --> 01:45:55,460
will settle everything themselves.

1347
01:45:56,490 --> 01:45:58,490
I'll remember.

1348
01:46:00,410 --> 01:46:02,410
In this case,

1349
01:46:02,430 --> 01:46:04,430
Xiwang did a better job.

1350
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:19,460
I sincerely hope you all can

1351
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:22,480
live the life you want.

1352
01:46:35,410 --> 01:46:37,410
This is the last time I'll help you.

1353
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:45,430
Shadow is deliberately stalling.
There's a chance to identify him

1354
01:46:45,450 --> 01:46:46,456
if he tries to move.

1355
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:49,480
Pinky. Remember the key tracking points?

1356
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:51,400
Look for distinctive and permanent features.

1357
01:46:51,430 --> 01:46:53,430
It's okay if your memory is hazy.

1358
01:46:54,450 --> 01:46:57,010
When you see that feature, your brain
automatically starts to help you.

1359
01:47:39,470 --> 01:47:41,470
I see him.

1360
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:43,500
He...

1361
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:45,520
Hello?

1362
01:48:03,450 --> 01:48:05,450
Get me out!

1363
01:49:03,470 --> 01:49:06,470
Madam, Pinky is not responding.
Potsticker and Tofu are at the location.

1364
01:49:06,490 --> 01:49:08,490
We need the characteristics of Target X.

1365
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:11,420
Too many people at the party. Everyone
looks like Target X to me now.

1366
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:13,440
Your Target X is 180 cm tall

1367
01:49:13,470 --> 01:49:15,470
weighing 68 kg.

1368
01:49:15,490 --> 01:49:17,490
Long hair. That's Wu Yaolei's
communication device.

1369
01:49:17,510 --> 01:49:19,410
He's sneaking into the VIP area.

1370
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:21,440
Animal Paradise, any valid info?

1371
01:49:22,460 --> 01:49:24,460
Stop him.

1372
01:49:27,490 --> 01:49:29,490
Use my earpiece. I'll
grab another one from the car.

1373
01:49:29,510 --> 01:49:31,510
Report your position.
They're worried about you.

1374
01:49:31,530 --> 01:49:33,610
Shadow has identified
Target X. Stay calm.

1375
01:49:35,460 --> 01:49:37,460
He and that driver are twins.

1376
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:42,480
Pinky at Animal Paradise.

1377
01:49:42,510 --> 01:49:44,510
Sorry for the worry.
Glad you're okay.

1378
01:49:44,530 --> 01:49:47,430
Find anything? The target and
that driver are twins.

1379
01:49:52,450 --> 01:49:54,450
VIP area, I might have found him.

1380
01:49:59,480 --> 01:50:01,480
Who are you? Sorry.

1381
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:06,406
Shouldn't have trusted
Shadow. He has his reasons.

1382
01:50:06,430 --> 01:50:08,430
Everyone, report your positions.
Tofu, south entrance.

1383
01:50:08,450 --> 01:50:11,450
Potsticker, north entrance.
Fat Bun, north side of the dance floor.

1384
01:50:11,470 --> 01:50:13,470
Rice Noodle and Lucky, laundry room.

1385
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:14,500
Alpaca.

1386
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:15,520
Where is Alpaca?

1387
01:50:15,550 --> 01:50:17,550
He gave me his earpiece,
went to get another one.

1388
01:50:17,570 --> 01:50:20,470
No new communication device has been
activated. His badge GPS shows

1389
01:50:20,490 --> 01:50:22,490
he's heading to Cotai East LRT station.

1390
01:50:30,420 --> 01:50:32,420
He and that driver are twins!

1391
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:40,440
Are you implying that...?

1392
01:51:42,470 --> 01:51:44,470
It no longer matters.

1393
01:52:02,490 --> 01:52:04,490
Fragile.

1394
01:52:04,510 --> 01:52:05,510
Lucky.

1395
01:52:05,540 --> 01:52:06,540
Calm.

1396
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:08,560
Energy.

1397
01:52:10,490 --> 01:52:11,490
Target.

1398
01:52:11,510 --> 01:52:13,410
Amateur.

1399
01:52:13,430 --> 01:52:14,430
Family.

1400
01:52:14,460 --> 01:52:16,460
Shadow.

1401
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:17,480
Betrayal.

1402
01:52:17,510 --> 01:52:19,510
Grateful. Blind.

1403
01:52:23,430 --> 01:52:25,430
Times have changed.

1404
01:52:25,450 --> 01:52:27,450
But rules remain rules.

1405
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:29,480
Simon...

1406
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:31,500
goodbye.

1407
01:52:37,430 --> 01:52:39,430
He's dead!

1408
01:52:43,450 --> 01:52:45,450
Madam, Officer Wong,

1409
01:52:45,470 --> 01:52:47,470
we captured 2
more. Without Shadow's guidance,

1410
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:49,500
they have nowhere to hide.

1411
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:51,520
What is the situation?

1412
01:52:52,450 --> 01:52:54,450
Ma'am, Officer Wong...

1413
01:53:03,470 --> 01:53:04,670
Liu Jinxiao. His vein was cut.

1414
01:53:04,690 --> 01:53:06,690
Guoguo, apply pressure to the wound.

1415
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:08,720
Don't let him move.

1416
01:53:08,740 --> 01:53:10,740
Black hat, dark blue jacket,

1417
01:53:15,470 --> 01:53:17,470
black jeans. Jinxiao!

1418
01:53:17,490 --> 01:53:19,490
Jinxiao, don't fall asleep!

1419
01:53:19,510 --> 01:53:22,410
Ambulance!

1420
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:25,440
Ambulance!

1421
01:53:40,490 --> 01:53:42,490
I understand your feelings,

1422
01:53:42,510 --> 01:53:44,510
but another unit has been assigned
to follow up.

1423
01:53:44,530 --> 01:53:46,530
We have a new task now.

1424
01:53:50,460 --> 01:53:52,460
In that case, I'll take a leave.

1425
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:54,480
I need a break, personal reasons.

1426
01:54:16,410 --> 01:54:19,410
What are you doing here?
Wu sent this order

1427
01:54:19,430 --> 01:54:21,430
to accompany someone on leave.

1428
01:54:21,450 --> 01:54:23,450
Eat up.

1429
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:24,480
Thank you.

1430
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:27,400
What's the status? No leads.

1431
01:54:27,430 --> 01:54:29,430
It's as if Shadow vanished into thin air.

1432
01:54:48,450 --> 01:54:49,450
Money.

1433
01:54:49,470 --> 01:54:51,470
Always leaves a trail,

1434
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:54,400
especially in cases like this.

1435
01:54:59,420 --> 01:55:02,420
This is where the victim's crypto
was first transferred.

1436
01:55:02,450 --> 01:55:04,450
The kids claimed only 2
people knew the password.

1437
01:55:04,470 --> 01:55:06,470
One of them is dead.

1438
01:55:06,490 --> 01:55:08,490
And the money wasn't moved, right?

1439
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:10,420
Not a single cent.

1440
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:12,440
Do you remember what
I said about the type of thief

1441
01:55:12,470 --> 01:55:14,470
Shadow might be?

1442
01:55:15,490 --> 01:55:18,490
Old-fashioned people. Traditional.

1443
01:55:19,410 --> 01:55:21,410
I don't know anything about this,

1444
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:23,440
and I suspect

1445
01:55:23,460 --> 01:55:26,460
he doesn't either. He's
still a man of his time.

1446
01:55:30,490 --> 01:55:32,490
What do you think he'll do?

1447
01:55:37,410 --> 01:55:39,410
He doesn't know how to unload crypto.

1448
01:55:44,430 --> 01:55:47,430
Fu is an old-school thief. His old method

1449
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:49,460
was robbing jewelry stores

1450
01:55:49,480 --> 01:55:51,480
and forcing victims
to buy back the stolen goods

1451
01:55:51,510 --> 01:55:54,150
to avoid trouble and
deal with the receiver.

1452
01:55:59,430 --> 01:56:01,430
That's all he knows.

1453
01:56:03,450 --> 01:56:04,450
Let's eat. No time.

1454
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:06,480
Let's go.

1455
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:20,430
Why not use the door?

1456
01:56:23,450 --> 01:56:26,450
Sophia, where are you?

1457
01:56:27,470 --> 01:56:28,470
Where's my milk?

1458
01:56:28,500 --> 01:56:30,500
It's been days.

1459
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:32,520
Did I misunderstand?

1460
01:56:33,450 --> 01:56:35,450
Trust your instincts.

1461
01:56:35,470 --> 01:56:37,470
Blame me if I'm wrong.

1462
01:56:40,490 --> 01:56:42,490
That's indeed my plan.

1463
01:56:43,420 --> 01:56:46,420
I've been thinking over the past few days.

1464
01:56:48,440 --> 01:56:50,440
Carrying out missions is our duty.

1465
01:56:51,470 --> 01:56:53,470
But having blood, emotions,

1466
01:56:53,490 --> 01:56:55,490
and a heart...

1467
01:56:55,510 --> 01:56:57,510
That's our nature.

1468
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:01,440
Being a cop shouldn't
take that away.

1469
01:57:07,460 --> 01:57:09,460
So, back then...

1470
01:57:12,490 --> 01:57:14,490
you didn't do anything wrong.

1471
01:57:48,410 --> 01:57:50,410
Police.

1472
01:57:50,430 --> 01:57:52,430
Everyone out.

1473
01:57:55,460 --> 01:57:57,460
I know you want to make up a story,

1474
01:57:57,480 --> 01:58:00,480
but don't make yourself an accomplice.

1475
01:58:02,410 --> 01:58:05,410
Fu demanded 10 million cash
from Wang for the account password.

1476
01:58:05,430 --> 01:58:07,430
Meeting at Tin Seng Tea
House. I'll inform Captain Wu.

1477
01:58:07,450 --> 01:58:09,450
Don't act before we get there.

1478
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:17,480
Wu, your ETA? 10 minutes.

1479
01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:19,500
Officer Wong. Less than 5 minutes.

1480
01:58:24,430 --> 01:58:26,430
We've tapped Qiuguo's phone.

1481
01:58:26,450 --> 01:58:28,450
Understood. Understood.

1482
01:58:32,470 --> 01:58:34,470
Sound check. Clear.

1483
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:37,400
Wang is 10 minutes late.

1484
01:58:37,420 --> 01:58:39,420
He could leave at any moment.

1485
01:58:47,450 --> 01:58:49,450
He's about to leave.

1486
01:58:54,470 --> 01:58:56,470
Hey. Next time use the front door.

1487
01:59:17,490 --> 01:59:19,490
It's a small world.

1488
01:59:30,420 --> 01:59:32,420
Alone?

1489
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:37,440
You've got the wrong person.

1490
01:59:39,470 --> 01:59:41,470
Don't you know me?

1491
01:59:43,490 --> 01:59:45,490
We've had dinner together.

1492
01:59:45,510 --> 01:59:47,510
Have you forgotten me?

1493
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:53,440
Do you need something?

1494
02:00:04,460 --> 02:00:06,460
Oh, I'm so touched.

1495
02:00:06,490 --> 02:00:09,490
So it's you. Uncle.

1496
02:00:09,510 --> 02:00:11,510
Why are you dressed like that? Your hair

1497
02:00:11,530 --> 02:00:14,430
scared me. I thought
you were a creepy old man

1498
02:00:14,460 --> 02:00:16,460
trying to hit on me.

1499
02:00:19,480 --> 02:00:21,480
Sorry for scaring you. Forgive me.

1500
02:00:21,510 --> 02:00:23,510
It's okay.

1501
02:00:25,430 --> 02:00:27,430
You're about to leave.

1502
02:00:27,450 --> 02:00:29,450
Are you planning to follow me?

1503
02:00:38,480 --> 02:00:40,480
Alone?

1504
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:42,400
Excuse me?

1505
02:00:42,430 --> 02:00:45,430
What do you mean?

1506
02:00:46,450 --> 02:00:48,450
A few days ago, you were at Wynn.

1507
02:00:50,470 --> 02:00:52,470
You were with a guy.

1508
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:57,400
Where is that guy now?

1509
02:01:03,420 --> 02:01:05,420
Dead.

1510
02:01:05,450 --> 02:01:07,450
Breakup?

1511
02:01:07,470 --> 02:01:09,470
Didn't you hear what I said?

1512
02:01:11,490 --> 02:01:13,490
He's dead.

1513
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:15,520
Team 2. Seal Ponte Cais de
Coloane and R. Navegantes.

1514
02:01:15,540 --> 02:01:18,440
Team 3, go to Entre-Campos,
Cordoaria and Cheoc Van.

1515
02:01:21,470 --> 02:01:23,470
He was killed at the LRT station.

1516
02:01:43,490 --> 02:01:45,490
The guy was a cop,

1517
02:01:48,410 --> 02:01:50,410
just like you. You're crazy!

1518
02:01:50,440 --> 02:01:52,440
Stay away from me!

1519
02:01:53,460 --> 02:01:55,460
Go!

1520
02:02:03,490 --> 02:02:05,490
You managed to waste my time. Kid...

1521
02:02:05,510 --> 02:02:07,510
you're quite skilled.

1522
02:02:21,430 --> 02:02:23,430
Guoguo.

1523
02:02:24,460 --> 02:02:26,460
Call an ambulance! Police!

1524
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:30,480
Get out of here!

1525
02:02:44,510 --> 02:02:46,510
Please go through the front door.

1526
02:03:46,430 --> 02:03:49,430
My West Lake sour fish. Do you like it?

1527
02:03:53,450 --> 02:03:55,450
It tastes terrible!

1528
02:03:55,480 --> 02:03:57,480
Drop dead!

1529
02:03:59,400 --> 02:04:01,400
Come with me.

1530
02:06:26,430 --> 02:06:28,430
Let's go!

1531
02:06:36,440 --> 02:06:38,440
Come on!

1532
02:07:24,460 --> 02:07:26,460
Guoguo!

1533
02:08:03,490 --> 02:08:05,490
Are you okay? The wound isn't deep.

1534
02:08:05,510 --> 02:08:07,510
I'll be fine.

1535
02:08:08,440 --> 02:08:10,440
Help is almost here.
Earpiece is in the pocket.

1536
02:08:11,460 --> 02:08:13,460
Guoguo... chase him!

1537
02:08:16,480 --> 02:08:18,600
The target is heading to the front door.
Wearing a wig and black jacket.

1538
02:08:19,410 --> 02:08:21,410
I'll go after him.

1539
02:08:47,430 --> 02:08:50,430
Pinky, he's heading north.
No CCTV in that alley.

1540
02:08:50,460 --> 02:08:52,460
You'll have to find him yourself.

1541
02:08:57,480 --> 02:08:59,480
Possible suspect sighted.

1542
02:09:03,400 --> 02:09:05,400
It's not Shadow after all.

1543
02:09:08,430 --> 02:09:10,430
The roads are so confusing,
I can't find him.

1544
02:09:10,450 --> 02:09:12,450
Qiuguo, stay calm.

1545
02:09:13,480 --> 02:09:15,480
Calm yourself.

1546
02:09:20,400 --> 02:09:22,400
I can't find him.

1547
02:09:24,420 --> 02:09:26,420
Pinky, help is almost there.

1548
02:09:26,450 --> 02:09:28,450
He can't be far. You can do it.

1549
02:09:34,470 --> 02:09:36,470
Remember the key tracking points?

1550
02:09:36,500 --> 02:09:38,500
He Qiuguo?

1551
02:09:39,420 --> 02:09:40,820
Pay attention and remember.

1552
02:09:40,840 --> 02:09:42,440
You only have one look.

1553
02:09:42,470 --> 02:09:45,470
Focus on the key spots. Alone?

1554
02:09:48,490 --> 02:09:49,490
Remember.

1555
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:51,520
Active recall first.

1556
02:09:51,540 --> 02:09:53,540
Where's that guy? Gradually...

1557
02:09:53,560 --> 02:09:56,460
Breakup? You'll start
remembering subconsciously.

1558
02:10:04,490 --> 02:10:06,490
Catch him!

1559
02:10:08,410 --> 02:10:10,410
Hand.

1560
02:10:16,440 --> 02:10:18,440
Bandage.

1561
02:10:35,460 --> 02:10:36,460
Target spotted.

1562
02:10:36,480 --> 02:10:37,486
I'm chasing him. Where are you?

1563
02:10:37,510 --> 02:10:39,510
North alley on R. do Meio

1564
02:10:39,530 --> 02:10:41,530
Wu, prepare for arrest.
We've arrived.

1565
02:10:46,460 --> 02:10:48,460
Sir, don't take painkillers like that.

1566
02:10:49,480 --> 02:10:51,480
Guoguo.

1567
02:10:51,500 --> 02:10:53,500
You can do it.

1568
02:10:56,430 --> 02:10:58,430
Wait!

1569
02:10:58,450 --> 02:11:00,456
Qiuguo, if I set a trap
at Chapel St. Francis Xavier,

1570
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:02,480
can you steer him this way?

1571
02:11:02,500 --> 02:11:04,500
Captain, I can't do this alone.

1572
02:11:05,420 --> 02:11:07,420
I need my team. I need the Surveillance Team.

1573
02:11:08,450 --> 02:11:10,450
Pinky, missed us?

1574
02:11:12,470 --> 02:11:14,470
Central, Fat Bun in position.

1575
02:11:14,500 --> 02:11:15,500
I'm at your 8 o'clock.

1576
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:17,520
Potsticker parallel, 3 o'clock.

1577
02:11:17,540 --> 02:11:19,540
Eggy in position. Tofu in position shocking.

1578
02:11:19,570 --> 02:11:21,570
9 o'clock, next street.

1579
02:11:25,490 --> 02:11:27,490
Calling Animal Paradise.

1580
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:29,520
Doghead is secure.

1581
02:11:31,440 --> 02:11:33,440
Rice Noodle at 2 o'clock.

1582
02:11:33,460 --> 02:11:35,460
I've studied and하시 analyzed Shadow's habits.

1583
02:11:35,490 --> 02:11:38,490
From this point, there are
165 possible escape routes.

1584
02:11:38,510 --> 02:11:41,410
17 of them reach
Chapel St. Francis Xavier.

1585
02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:45,440
Pudding behind you.

1586
02:11:45,460 --> 02:11:47,460
Lucky directly ahead of target.

1587
02:11:47,480 --> 02:11:49,480
Coordinates and direction to the team.

1588
02:11:49,510 --> 02:11:51,510
I'll keep calculating his route choices
and you'll be informed.

1589
02:11:51,530 --> 02:11:53,530
Doghead calling Animal Paradise.

1590
02:11:53,560 --> 02:11:55,560
Paws Unit on site.

1591
02:11:57,480 --> 02:11:59,480
Alpaca in position.

1592
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:02,400
Calling Animal Paradise.

1593
02:12:04,430 --> 02:12:05,430
Pinky on position.

1594
02:12:05,450 --> 02:12:07,456
Attention, Cute Unit, Field
Chapel St. Francis Xavier

1595
02:12:07,480 --> 02:12:09,480
about 280 meters northwest

1596
02:12:09,500 --> 02:12:11,500
from current target location.

1597
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:13,520
Shadow is injured. He values his life.

1598
02:12:13,550 --> 02:12:15,550
All he wants now is to escape.

1599
02:12:15,570 --> 02:12:17,930
He won't risk getting shot
to harm you.

1600
02:12:18,400 --> 02:12:20,400
Cute Unit. You're the hunters now.

1601
02:12:21,420 --> 02:12:23,420
Surround and hunt.

1602
02:13:41,440 --> 02:13:43,440
Don't move!

1603
02:13:47,470 --> 02:13:49,470
Hands above your head!

1604
02:14:10,490 --> 02:14:12,490
I'm fine.

1605
02:14:22,420 --> 02:14:24,420
I'm the police.

1606
02:14:24,440 --> 02:14:26,440
Fu Longsheng, you're under arrest.

1607
02:14:30,460 --> 02:14:32,460
Madam.

1608
02:14:32,490 --> 02:14:34,490
He Qiuguo.

1609
02:14:36,410 --> 02:14:38,410
You're the one who made this happen.

1610
02:14:39,440 --> 02:14:41,440
You cuff me.

1611
02:14:51,460 --> 02:14:53,460
What's so funny?

1612
02:14:53,480 --> 02:14:55,480
You're quite the fighter.

1613
02:14:55,510 --> 02:14:57,510
Silence!

1614
02:14:57,530 --> 02:14:59,530
Guoguo.

1615
02:15:10,460 --> 02:15:12,460
Command Center,

1616
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:14,480
we have detained Fu Longsheng.

1617
02:15:21,400 --> 02:15:22,400
Very good.

1618
02:15:22,430 --> 02:15:24,430
Your father must be very proud.

1619
02:15:29,450 --> 02:15:31,450
Sir.

1620
02:15:33,480 --> 02:15:35,480
Request to join the interrogation.
Aren't you on leave?

1621
02:15:35,500 --> 02:15:37,500
Request to end my leave.

1622
02:15:39,420 --> 02:15:41,420
I really miss my job.

1623
02:15:42,450 --> 02:15:45,450
We will definitely need your help later.

1624
02:15:46,470 --> 02:15:48,470
I've already taught them

1625
02:15:48,500 --> 02:15:50,500
everything I know.

1626
02:15:50,520 --> 02:15:53,420
I want to return to my retirement.

1627
02:15:54,440 --> 02:15:56,440
To the hospital first!
